*Title: What do you look like 
The day of the trip arrives sooner than you thought, and you find yourself flustered on what you're going to wear.
In the spur of  the moment you throw on a quick outfit:

*Choice
#Jeans and a T-shirt. I like to be comfortable
Good choice, no point in showing off on your vacation
*Finish
#Button up shirt and dresspants. I dress to impress.
Looking Sharp there, go knock 'em dead! figuretively, of course
*Finish
