“You have won an all Inclusive trip to the infamous Macabre Mansion”

Your heart is racing. You entered a drawing for this trip, thinking you wouldn't possibly win. Yet here you are. 

The trip is a month from now but you're so excited that you start packing right away. 
Besides clothes, deoderant, and all your basic needs, you want to bring one more thing
However, there's not much room after shoving all of your stuff in your bags.
